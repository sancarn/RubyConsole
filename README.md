# RubyConsole

This project was initially written due to the lack of `irb` in InfoWorks ICM. However the console has now been extended to work on all operating systems using regular ruby.

This console requires Google Chrome to be installed.

Theoretically this isn't limited to chrome, however I am unsure of the correct commands to make this workable in other browsers.

I will try to add new compatibility over time.
